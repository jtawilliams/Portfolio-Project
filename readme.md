This is my Portfolio Project site. I chose to make it a 4 page site with a Home page, About page, Contact page, and one that says Dont Click that takes you to a picture of a dog.

At the top of the site on every page except the Dont Press page which is a picture there is a nav bar that has the options of Home, About, Contact, and Dont Press and works on all pages.

The Home page of the site which you see when you go to the site say my name at the top and has a picture of me, and at the bottom it has a button that says back to top and will take you back to the top of the page.

The About page says About at the top and has some fact about where i lived growing up.

The contact page says Contact at the top and has different ways to contact me by Email, Facebook, Instagram, Slack, and Github.

The last page is just a picture of a mean looking dog which is why the nav bar button says Dont Press.
